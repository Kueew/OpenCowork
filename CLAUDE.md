# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start Electron + Vite with hot reload (primary dev loop).
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with cache. Minimum validation before committing.
- `npm run typecheck` — runs both `typecheck:node` (main/preload, `tsconfig.node.json`) and `typecheck:web` (renderer, `tsconfig.web.json`). Strict TS.
- `npm run format` — Prettier.
- `npm run build` — typecheck then `electron-vite build`.
- `npm run build:unpack` — build + unpacked app for packaging checks.
- `npm run build:{win|mac|linux}` — full packaged installer.
- Docs workspace (separate Next.js + Fumadocs project in `docs/`): `npm --prefix docs run dev|build|types:check`.

There is no root test suite. For UI/IPC/workflow changes, smoke test with `npm run dev`. For packaging changes, run the corresponding `build:*` command.

## Architecture

Four-layer Electron + Node.js app. Keep process boundaries explicit — system access stays in main, UI state stays in renderer, shared types go through `src/shared`.

1. **Electron main (`src/main/`)** — system layer. App bootstrap (`index.ts`), window lifecycle, IPC handlers (`ipc/`), SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (`db/`, `migration/`), cron (`cron/`, `node-cron`), channels/plugins for Feishu/DingTalk/Discord (`channels/`), MCP clients (`mcp/`), SSH (`ssh/`, `ssh2` + `node-pty`), auto-updates (`updater.ts`), crash logging.
2. **Preload (`src/preload/`)** — secure bridge exposing a narrow API surface to the renderer. All main↔renderer traffic goes through here; do not add `nodeIntegration` shortcuts.
3. **Renderer (`src/renderer/src/`)** — React 19 UI. Zustand stores (`stores/`), i18n (`locales/`, `react-i18next`), Tailwind v4, Monaco, xterm, recharts. The renderer owns message presentation, approvals, and session UX. `session-runtime-router.ts` buffers message state for background (non-visible) sessions and flushes it when those sessions come to the foreground.
4. **Main-process agent runtime (`src/main/ipc/js-agent-runtime.ts`, `src/main/cron/cron-agent-background.ts`)** — the unified Node.js agent loop. It owns provider transport, retry/circuit behavior, tool execution routing, approval hand-off, and event streaming back to the renderer over the existing IPC protocol.

Agent execution now runs in the main-process JS runtime. The renderer remains the UI and tool/approval surface; it no longer hosts a separate provider runtime.

Bundled runtime assets (shipped to users, loaded at runtime — not source): `resources/agents`, `resources/skills`, `resources/prompts`, `resources/commands`.

SQLite database lives at `~/.open-cowork/data.db`. Schema evolves via additive `ensureColumn` calls in `src/main/db/database.ts` — there are no migration files; columns are added if absent, never dropped.

`src/shared/` holds cross-process TypeScript contracts. `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib` at the repo root (not under `renderer/`) are additional shared utilities.

Generated/ignored: `dist/`, `out/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`. Do not edit.

## Conventions

- `.editorconfig`: UTF-8, LF, 2 spaces, final newline, trimmed trailing whitespace.
- `.prettierrc.yaml`: single quotes, **no semicolons**, 100-column width, no trailing commas.
- React component files are PascalCase (`Layout.tsx`); stores/helpers/non-component modules are kebab-case (`settings-store.ts`).
- Commit style from history: conventional commits — `feat(scope): ...`, `fix(scope): ...`, `chore(scope): ...`, `refactor(scope): ...`, `style(scope): ...`. Keep commits focused; don't mix refactors with behavior changes.
- When bumping the app version in `package.json`, also update the docs homepage version in `docs/src/app/(home)/page.tsx` and keep download links aligned with release assets.
- Never commit local runtime data from `~/.open-cowork/`.
